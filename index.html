I am a deep learning enthusiast and a self-educator in related fields (machine learning).

In this site, I am planning to share with you things I have learned (in a broad aspect). My posts will be mostly about
machine learning, software development and other useful experiences in my professional life.

I hope you find my posts helpful!
